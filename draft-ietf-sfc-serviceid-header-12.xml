    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines two Variable-Length Context Headers that can be
      carried in the Network Service Header: the Subscriber and Performance
      Policy Identifiers. These Context Headers are used to inform Service
      Functions of subscriber- and performance-related information for the
      sake of policy enforcement and appropriate service function chaining
      operations. The structure of each Context Header, and their use and
      processing by NSH-aware nodes, are described.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document discusses how to inform Service Functions (SFs) <xref
      target="RFC7665"></xref> about subscriber and service policy
      information, when required for the sake of policy enforcement within a
      single administrative domain. In particular, subscriber-related
      information may be required to enforce subscriber-specific SFC-based
      traffic policies. However, the information carried in packets may not be
      sufficient to unambiguously identify a subscriber. This document fills
      this void by specifying a new Network Service Header (NSH) <xref
      target="RFC8300"></xref> Context Header to convey and disseminate such
      information within the boundaries of a single administrative domain
      (<xref target="solutions"></xref>).</t>

      <t>Also, traffic steering by means of SFC may be driven, for example, by
      QoS (Quality of Service) considerations. Typically, QoS information may
      serve as an input for the computation, establishment, and selection of
      the Service Function Path (SFP). Furthermore, the dynamic structuring of
      service function chains and their subsequent SFPs may be conditioned by
      QoS requirements that will affect SF instance(s) identification,
      location, and sequencing. Hence, the need arises to provide downstream
      SFs with a performance policy identifier in order for them to
      appropriately meet the QoS service requirements. This document also
      specifies a new NSH Context Header (<xref target="sol2"></xref>) to
      convey such policy identifiers.</t>

      <t>The context information defined in this document can be applicable in
      the context of mobile networks (particularly, in the 3GPP defined (S)Gi
      Interface) <xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility"></xref>.
      Typically, because of the widespread use of private IPv4 addresses in
      those networks, if the SFs to be invoked are located after a NAT
      function, the identification based on the internal IPv4 address is not
      possible once the NAT has been crossed. NAT functionality can reside in
      a distinct node. For a 4G 3GPP network, that node can be the Packet Data
      Network (PDN) Gateway (PGW) as specified in <xref
      target="TS23401"></xref>. For a 5G 3GPP network, it can be the User
      Plane Function (UPF) facing the external Data Network (DN) <xref
      target="TS23501"></xref>. As such, a mechanism to pass the internal
      information past the NAT boundary may optimise packet traversal within
      an SFC-enabled mobile network domain. Furthermore, some SFs that are not
      enabled on the PGW/UPF may require a subscriber identifier to properly
      operate (see, for example, those listed in <xref
      target="RFC8371"></xref>). It is outside the scope of this document to
      include a comprehensive list of deployments which may make use of the
      Context Headers defined in the document.</t>

      <t>Since subscriber identifiers are distinct from those used to identify
      a performance policy and given that multiple policies may be associated
      with a single subscriber within a service function chain, these
      identifiers are carried in distinct Context Headers rather than
      multiplexing them in one single Context Header. This approach avoids a
      requirement for additional internal structure in the Context Headers to
      specify whether an identifier refers to a subscriber or to a policy.</t>

      <t>This document does not make any assumption about the structure of
      subscriber or performance policy identifiers; each such identifier is
      treated as an opaque value. The semantics and validation of these
      identifiers are policies local to each SFC-enabled domain. This document
      focuses on the data plane behaviour. Control plane considerations are
      out of the scope.</t>

      <t>The reader may refer to Section 5 of <xref target="RFC8300"></xref>
      for MTU considerations. Such considerations are not reiterated here.</t>

      <t>This document adheres to the SFC data plane architecture defined in
      <xref target="RFC7665"></xref>. This document assumes the reader is
      familiar with <xref target="RFC8300"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document assumes the NSH is used exclusively within a single
      administrative domain. This document adheres to the recommendations in
      <xref target="RFC8300"></xref> for handling the Context Headers at both
      ingress and egress SFC boundary nodes (i.e., to strip the entire NSH,
      including Context Headers). Revealing any personal and
      subscriber-related information to parties outside the SFC-enabled domain
      is avoided by design. Accordingly, the scope for privacy breaches and
      user tracking is limited to within the SFC-enabled domain where the NSH
      is used.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Metadata Class: MUST be set to 0x0 <xref
          target="RFC8300"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Type: TBD1 (See <xref target="IANA"></xref>).</t>

          <t>U bit: Unassigned bit (see Section 2.5.1 of <xref
          target="RFC8300"></xref>).</t>

          <t>Length: Indicates the length of the Subscriber Identifier, in
          bytes (see Section 2.5.1 of <xref target="RFC8300"></xref>).</t>

          <t>Subscriber Identifier: Carries an opaque local identifier that is
          assigned to a subscriber by a network operator.<vspace
          blankLines="1" />While this document does not specify an internal
          structure for these identifiers, it also does not provide any
          cryptographic protection for them; any internal structure to the
          identifier values chosen will thus be visible on the wire if no
          secure transport encapsulation is used. Accordingly, in alignment
          with Section 8.2.2 of <xref target="RFC8300"></xref>, identifier
          values SHOULD be obfsucated.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The Subscriber Identifier Context Header is used by service functions
      to enforce per-subscriber policies (e.g., resource quota, customized
      filtering profile, accounting). To that aim, network operators may rely
      on identifiers that are generated from those used in legacy deployments
      (e.g., Section 3.3 of<xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility">
      </xref>). Alternatively, network operators may use identifiers that are
      associated with customized policy profiles that are preconfigured on SFs
      using an out of band mechanism. Such mechanism can be used to rotate the
      identifiers allowing thus for better unlinkability (Section 3.2 of <xref
      target="RFC6973"></xref>). Such alternative methods may be suboptimal
      (e.g., scalability issues induced by maintaining and processing finer
      granular profiles) or inadequate to provide some per-subscriber
      policies. The assessment whether a method for defining a subscriber
      identifier provides the required functionality and that it is compliant
      with SFs capabilities with the intended performance levels is deployment
      specific.</t>

      <t>The classifier and NSH-aware SFs MAY inject a Subscriber Identifier
      Context Header as a function of a local policy. In order to prevent
      interoperability issues, the type and format of the identifiers to be
      injected in a Subscriber Identifier Context Header should be configured
      to nodes authorized to inject and consume such headers. For example, a
      node can be instructed to insert such data following a type/set scheme
      (e.g., node X should inject subscriber ID type Y). Other schemes may be
      envisaged.</t>

      <t>Failures to inject such headers should be logged locally while a
      notification alarm may be sent to a Control Element. The details of
      sending notification alarms (i.e., the parameters affecting the
      transmission of the notification alarms) might depend on the nature of
      the information in the Context Header. Parameters for sending alarms,
      such as frequency, thresholds, and content of the alarm, should be
      configurable.</t>

      <t>The default behavior of intermediary NSH-aware nodes is to preserve
      Subscriber Identifier Context Headers (i.e., the information can be
      passed to next hop NSH-aware nodes), but local policy may require an
      intermediary NSH-aware node to strip a Subscriber Identifier Context
      Header after processing it.</t>

      <t>NSH-aware SFs MUST ignore Context Headers carrying unknown subscriber
      identifiers.</t>

      <t>Local policies at NSH-aware SFs may require running additional
      validation checks on the content of these Context Headers (e.g., accept
      only some lengths or types). These policies may also indicate the
      behavior to follow by an NSH-aware SF if the validation checks fail
      (e.g., remove the Context Header from the packet). These additional
      validation checks are deployment-specific. If validation checks fail on
      a Subscriber Identifier Context Header, an NSH-aware SF MUST ignore that
      Context Header. The event should be logged locally while a notification
      alarm may be sent to a Control Element if the NSH-aware SF is instructed
      to do so. For example, an SF that expects a subscriber identifier
      generated from an internal IP address will discard Subscriber Identifier
      Context Headers conveying identifiers generated from Mobile Subscriber
      ISDN Number (MSISDN), International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI),
      or malformed IP addresses.</t>

      <t>Multiple Subscriber Identifier Context Headers MAY be present in the
      NSH, each carrying a distinct opaque value but all pointing to the same
      subscriber. This may be required, e.g., by policy enforcement mechanisms
      in a mobile network where some SFs rely on IP addresses as subscriber
      Identifiers, while others use non-IP specific identifiers such as those
      listed in <xref target="RFC8371"></xref> and Section 3.3.2 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility"></xref>. When multiple
      subscriber identifier Context Headers are present and an SF is
      instructed to strip the Subscriber Identifier Context Header, that SF
      MUST remove all Subscriber Identifier Context Headers.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sol2"
             title="Performance Policy Identification NSH Variable-Length Context Headers">
      <t>Dedicated service-specific performance identifiers are defined to
      differentiate between services that require specific treatment in order
      to exhibit a performance characterized by, e.g., ultra-low latency (ULL)
      or ultra-high reliability (UHR). Other policies can be considered when
      instantiating a service function chain within an SFC-enabled domain.
      They are conveyed in the Performance Policy Identifier Context
      Header.</t>

      <t>The Performance Policy Identifier Context Header is inserted in an
      NSH packet so that downstream NSH-aware nodes can make use of the
      performance information for proper distributed SFC path selection, SF
      instance selection, or policy selection at SFs. Note that the use of the
      Performance Policy Identifier is not helpful if the path computation is
      centralized and a strict SFP is presented as local policy to SF
      Forwarders (SFFs).</t>

      <t>The Performance Policy Identifier allows for the distributed
      enforcement of a per-service policy such as a service function path to
      only include specific SFs instances (e.g., SFs located within the same
      DC or those that are exposing the shortest delay from an SFF). Details
      of this process are implementation-specific. For illustration purposes,
      an SFF may retrieve the details of usable SFs based upon the
      corresponding performance policy identifier. Typical criteria for
      instantiating specific SFs include location, performance, or proximity
      considerations. For the particular case of UHR services, the stand-by
      operation of back-up capacity or the presence of SFs deployed in
      multiple instances may be requested.</t>

      <t>In an environment characterised by frequent changes of link and path
      behaviour, for example due to variable load or availability caused by
      propagation conditions on a wireless link, the SFP may have to be
      adapted dynamically by on-the-move SFC path and SF instance
      selection.</t>

      <t>Performance Policy Identifier is defined as an optional variable
      length Context Header. Its structure is shown in <xref
      target="arch9"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The default behavior of intermediary NSH-aware nodes have to preserve
      such Context Headers (i.e., the information can be passed to next hop
      NSH-aware nodes), but local policy may require an intermediary NSH-aware
      node to strip one after processing it.</t>

      <t>Multiple Performance Policy Identifier Context Headers MAY be present
      in the NSH, each carrying an opaque value for a distinct policy that
      need to be enforced for a flow. Supplying conflicting policies may
      complicate the SFP computation and SF instance location. Corresponding
      rules to detect conflicting policies may be provided as a local policy
      to the NSH-aware nodes. When such conflict is detected by an NSH-aware
      node, the default behavior of the node is to discard the packet and send
      a notification alarm to a Control Element.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Data plane SFC-related security considerations, including privacy,
      are discussed in Section 6 <xref target="RFC7665"></xref> and Section 8
      of <xref target="RFC8300"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Nodes that are involved in an SFC-enabled domain are assumed to be
      trusted (Section 1.1 of <xref target="RFC8300"> </xref>). Means to check
      that only authorized nodes are solicited when a packet is crossing an
      SFC-enabled domain are out of scope of this document.</t>

      <t>Both Subscriber Identifier and Performance Policy Context Headers
      carry opaque data. This identifier is locally assigned by a network
      provider and can be generated from some of the information that is
      already conveyed in the original packets from a host (e.g., internal IP
      address) or other information that is collected from various sources
      within an SFC-enabled domain (e.g., line identifier). The structure of
      the identifiers conveyed in these Context Headers is communicated only
      to entitled NSH-aware nodes. Nevertheless, some structures may be easily
      inferred from the headers if trivial stuctures are used (e.g., IP
      addresses). The use of indirect and non-persistent identification is
      thus RECOMMENDED. </t>

      <t>Moreover, the presence of multiple Subscriber Identifier Context
      Headers in the same NSH allows a misbehaving node from within the
      SFC-enabled domain to bind these identifiers to the same subscriber.
      This can be used to track that subscriber more effectively. If
      encryption is not enabled, the use of non persistent identifiers as well
      as the removal of the Subscriber Identifier Context Headers from the NSH
      by the last SF making use of such headers soften this issue.</t>

      <t>A misbehaving node from within the SFC-enabled domain may alter the
      content of Subscriber Identifier and Performance Policy Context Headers
      which may lead to service disruption. Such attack is not unique to the
      Context Headers defined in this document; measures discussed in Section
      8 of <xref target="RFC8300"></xref> are to be followed. A mechanism for
      NSH integrity is specified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh-integrity"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If no secure transport encapsulation is enabled, the use of trivial
      subscriber identifier structures together with the presence of specific
      SFs in a service function chain may reveal sensitive information to
      every on-path device (but also to teams managing these devices). Such
      disclosure can be a violation in many jurisdictions because such
      information should be available to very few network operator personnel.
      Furthermore, access to subscriber data usually requires specific access
      privilege levels. To maintain that protection, an SF keeping operational
      logs should not log the content of a Subscriber and Performance Policy
      Context Headers unless the SF actually uses the content of these headers
      for its operation. As discussed in Section 8.2.2 of <xref
      target="RFC8300"></xref>, subscriber-identifying information should be
      obfuscated and, if an operator deems cryptographic integrity protection
      needed, security features in the transport encapsulation protocol (such
      as IPsec) must be used. A mechanism for encrypting sensitive NSH data is
      specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh-integrity"></xref>. This
      mechanism can be considered by network operators when enhanced SF-to-SF
      security protection of NSH metadata (e.g., protect against compromised
      SFFs) is required.</t>

      <t>Some events are logged locally with notification alerts sent by
      NSH-aware nodes to a Control Element. These events SHOULD be rate
      limited.</t>
